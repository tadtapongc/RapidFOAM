# Changelog

All notable changes to RapidFOAM will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- **Cluster Case Download**: Download finished cases from a remote SLURM cluster to the local machine, streamed as a remote `tar` archive.
- **Live Download Progress**: Per-case progress reporting with a live progress bar in the Web Studio, plus a guard against re-downloading completed cases.
- **Graceful Job Cancel**: Cancel remote jobs with an automatic write-and-reconstruct step so partial parallel results are preserved.

### Fixed
- Force coefficient parsing, cluster safety checks, and axis handling.
- Prevented progress regression during downloads and repaired Web Studio UI controls.
- 3D viewer now displays the real `geometry.stl` geometry.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-10

### Initial Public Release

#### Core CFD Automation Engine
- **Automated Case Generation**: Complete OpenFOAM case scaffolding (`0/`, `constant/`, `system/`) from a single JSON configuration.
- **Dynamic Wind Tunnel Derivation**: Computes virtual wind tunnel bounding boxes automatically from ASCII STL CAD bounds with upstream, downstream, roof, and lateral buffer ratios.
- **snappyHexMesh Refinement Heuristics**: Automated generation of surface refinements, explicit feature edge meshes (`surfaceFeatureExtract`), distance refinement shells, and two-stage wake refinement regions (`nearWakeBox`, `farWakeBox`).
- **Boundary Layer Inflation**: Automated prism layer extrusion settings targeting $y^+$ guidelines.
- **Mesh Fidelity Presets**: Built-in presets (`fast`, `standard`, `fine`) with predefined cell count budgets and refinement levels.
- **Symmetry Plane Support**: Half-car simulation support (e.g. `x = 0`) with automatic 2x force scaling across reports and comparisons.
- **Execution Pipeline Scripts**: Generates hardened POSIX execution scripts (`Allrun`, `Allrun.parallel`, `Allclean`, `run.sh`) with signal handling, background monitor termination, and interrupted parallel run reconstruction.
- **OpenFOAM Compatibility**: Supports ESI-OpenCFD releases (`v2006` through `v2606`) and OpenFOAM Foundation (`v8`–`v11`).

#### Real-Time Telemetry & Convergence Monitoring
- **Convergence Auto-Stop**: Live background monitor analyzing rolling window force variation ($\pm 0.5\%$) and gracefully signaling OpenFOAM solvers to stop via `stopAt writeNow;`.
- **Force Analysis CLI**: `rapidfoam-forces` tool for tabulating Drag, Downforce, and L/D ratios, live polling, and multi-case comparisons.

#### Interactive Web Studio
- **3D Viewport**: Real-time CAD and domain wireframe inspection using Three.js and OrbitControls.
- **Live Telemetry Charts**: Streaming force and residual curves powered by Chart.js.
- **Parameter & Preset Editor**: In-browser configuration manager with template presets.
- **Remote Cluster Execution**: SLURM cluster management over SSH/SFTP with job submission (`sbatch`), queue monitoring (`squeue`), and remote log inspection.

#### Packaging & Testing
- Pure zero-dependency core running on Python 3.9+ standard library.
- Comprehensive test suite covering regression checks, script synthesis, API security, and cluster telemetry.
